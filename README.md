# Terrible Chess

A simple chess AI that has a rating of approximately 200 ELO on sites like Chess.com or Lichess. 
In the SmartMoveFinder, you will find a depth option. The AI will work best on 4, meaning a good compromise between waiting time and good counter play. 

Further comments are in the code. Everything is written in Python. It is important to make sure you have the modules needed at the start of the code. 
See the imports. 

Images and sounds are added recently, these are home-made and can be used without the need of any permission. 
Images are in PNG format to safe as much space as possible while retaining superior flexibility in resolution. 

Keep in mind that for every audio file, you HAVE to change the directory in which the file is housed. Do not forget to use // instead of /!
(Same goes for the Piece Images!)
For any questions about this, do not hesitate to send a message. 

If you are feeling adventurous, read the init.py file for some big improvements that can be made. The sources to some information needed are included.

Good luck, 
slapper
